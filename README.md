# wiki-scraper-and-summarizer

Implemented a front-end web service utilizing API requests and HTTP methods to obtain data from Wikipedia based on the user’s provided link along with a group member’s microservice which summarizes the information. 

The user is able to request their summarization sentence length, if a sentence length is not passed the service will return a one setence summary. 

This was a group project created though Agile development methods such as scrums, two-week sprints, and using GitHub Project’s Kanban board to track progress. I was able to peer program with other group members to help them overcome errors and barriers.
